# LabView Weather Simulation Project

## Overview

This repository contains the source code for a LabView project developed for the "Electronic Measurements and Sensors" course at the Technical University of Cluj-Napoca, Department of Computer Science and Information Technology, during the second year, first semester.

## Project Description

The LabView Weather Simulation project simulates meteorological conditions by virtually placing sensors on an agricultural field. These sensors indicate the type of weather phenomenon present in the agricultural area based on the data transmitted by three indices: humidity, temperature, and dust.

## Features

- Virtual sensor placement: Simulates the placement of sensors on the agricultural field.
- Weather indication: Provides real-time indication of the weather phenomenon based on humidity, temperature, and dust indices.
- Interactive interface: Allows users to interact with the simulation and observe changes in weather conditions.
